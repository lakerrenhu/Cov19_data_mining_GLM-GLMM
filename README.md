#Abstract: In this step of term project, both Poisson and negative binomial models are
fitted based on the dataset of Coronavirus-2019 in Florida, containing about 22,000
observations. The response is a binary categorical variable presented by death status,
other explanatory variables include age, gender, days after the first infected case. From
the criteria of AIC, Deviance and AUC, logit, probit, Poisson and negative binomial
models fit the data well. According to the AIC, the probit model is the best; according to
the AUC, the negative model is slightly better than other ones.
